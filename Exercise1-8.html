	<h1> DEFINATIONS </h1>
	<dl> 
<dt> Gravitational Force :- </dt>
<dd>The force of gravity, or gravitational force, pulls objects with mass toward each other. We often think about the force of gravity from Earth. This force is what keeps your body on the ground. But any object with mass exerts a gravitational force on all other objects with mass.</dd> <br>
<dt> velocity :-</dt>
<dd>Velocity is quickness of motion or action. A synonym is celerity; a simpler word is speed. In physics, velocity specifically refers to the measurement of the rate and direction of change in position of an object.</dd> <br>
<dt> Mass :- </dt>
<dd>mass is the quantity of matter within a given object. Mass is determined by the atomic and molecular makeups of objects. All objects are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and each of these has different makeups and masses.</dd>
